=========

Role Variables
--------------

```bash
docker_users:
  - docker
```

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      become: true
      roles:
         - { role: ansible-role-docker, x: 42 }
